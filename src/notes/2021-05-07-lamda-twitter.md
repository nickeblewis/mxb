The previews that appear at the bottom of these "notes" are generated by #lambda #functions via [@netlify](https://twitter.com/netlify) using Eleventy. I write these items using Visual Studio Code, commit them and push to Github. A build is triggered for my site and it is then deployed. On each successful deploy, a serverless function is fired that then communicates with the Twitter API. Gradually people will respond to the tweet and every night at midnight, another script runs that gathers all the new webmentions and applies these to the note pages.

It is a tad complicated but it works very very well indeed!
