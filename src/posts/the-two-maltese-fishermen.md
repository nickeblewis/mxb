Here I kick off a simple photoblog series and fish through some archive images that take us back to around 2014. We were staying in the coastal town of Sliema, just along the coast from Malta's capital Valetta and these men caught my eye one afternoon. We had taken a walk as far as Ta'Xbiex from our hotel in the middle of Sliema and on the way back near the ferry terminal, spotted these gentlemen. They were oblivious to my presence and I think they were putting the world to rights whilst waiting for a catch.

I am pretty sure, I've got a few more to share from this very trip - you can't beat a bit of quality time digging through the archives!
