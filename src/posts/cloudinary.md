<p class="lead">Having recently discovered a cloudinary add-on that enables you to use Lightroom filters, I had to explore further...</p>

Digging through my Cloudinary account, I decided to search for an image I had totally forgotten about and I came across this photo. I must have taken this with my old Nikon camera and I think this was taken in the workshops at the fabulous Bluebell Line railway in Sussex. The first image is not processed but is being accessed from Cloudinary itself and not the same server as this site. I will have a little play with the image as we go along to explore what we can do. At this stage, there is no lightroom manipulation at all.

## The basic image with no manipulations

Dependent on where you are and your internet speed, this first image may take longer to load than any other on this page because it is not scaled, nor compressed in any way. However once it is cached on the DNS that underpins Cloudinary, it will load faster.

## Let's scale it a bit

``

In this instance I have added ``c_scale,w_320`` into the URL path, which essentially specifies the image filter of ``c_scale`` and that we want to scale the image to 320 along the width. It scales the height to be proportional to this.

## Let's add Lightroom to the mix

It is important to note here that I have activated the Lightroom add-on within Cloudinary without which the following wouldn't work. Let's break this down a bit. I did have a bit of an issue with the docs for this, they are either out of date or I have missed something. I found another way of setting this up, so if anyone out there has used these tools before, you may know why the token is added:

``https://res.cloudinary.com/dqpknoetx/image/upload/s--KFaVX6Ny--/c_scale,e_lightroom:VignetteAmount_-50:Saturation_-100,w_640/v1423155364/train.jpg``

``s--KFaVX6Ny--`` appears to be this token and was generated by Cloudinary. If I were now to change any of the paramters, it will no longer work. So a bit confused by that, anyway, let's skip over that for the minute...

``e_lightroom:VignetteAmount_-50:Saturation_-100`` use Lightroom's Vignette preset and drop the saturation down 100%, effectively turning the photo black and white.

## To finish off

Some more images from my Cloudinary account with some Lightroom filters or presets applied. Including this gorgeous shot of Rome from one of the hilltops.

A recent shot taken in Rotherwick, Hampshire with a little bit of extra vibrance added in Lightroom
