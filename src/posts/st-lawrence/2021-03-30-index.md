Could this be [Thomas Henry Wyatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Wyatt)? Thomas was the architect who re-built the church in the 1868. He was President of the RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) and had a prolific career working on a huge number of projects across the land. One other notable building that I am eager to visit again is Winchester Castle followed by a number of churches he was responsible for.
