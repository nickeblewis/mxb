## The backstory

I have written this article to be honest to help myself out of a hole. I wish to close my current business and start all over again. To move from running a Limited Company to one that operates on a sole trader basis. So the notes I have assembled here are a bold mix of:

- Experience
- Research
- Fresh ideas

I hope this article helps anyone else who may be in the same, or at least similar situation. The past year has forced many of us to pivot, to take a change in our direction
