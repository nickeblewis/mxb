## The background
Recently I have been reviewing Cloudinary which I've been signed up with for several years and it works really nicely but can I easily integrate Lightroom with it? That is something I am reviewing at the moment and haven't got anywhere near wrapping up on just yet. I will also review what Google has on offer and maybe some other providers out there but for this post, let's take a look at what Amazon has to offer.

## Reviewing Amazon photos
I have long been intrigued by the very impressive offer of unlimited photo storage with Amazon, a perk that I believe is only available if you are a Prime customer, which I am and have been since it first became available, early adopter and all of that. So far I haven't tried it out and there are a few things I'd like to test it against. So in order for Amazon Photos to be absolutely what I need to maintain an online library of photos that I can tap into for display on my website amongst many other things, here is a little checklist:

- Is it really unlimited because oh boy, I will be dumping a zillion large files in there for many years to come
- Can I grab a URL and paste into any page of my website?
- Are their options for on-the-fly manipulation?
- Is it underpinned by a CDN much like Cloudinary? Well Cloudinary is built on top of AWS, so it should be yeah?

## Lets get started

## Drive or Photos? What is the difference?

## Upload some images to test

## An ongoing photo backup routine

## Accessing my images via web

## Accessing my images from a mobile app

## Image editing
