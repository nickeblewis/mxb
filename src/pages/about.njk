                <p>
                    I have worked a lot with digital agencies across the country
                    dedicated to creating innovative digital products. Now I am about to embark on a new 
                    adventure. I am turning away from freelancing and contracting after a long time to work for 
                    London based [Vixio](https://vixio.com)
                </p>
            
                <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>
                    I like writing about web development, design and photography on my blog. My articles have been featured in magazines over the years.
